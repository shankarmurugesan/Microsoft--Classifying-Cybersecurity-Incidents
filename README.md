# Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification

---

## Project Overview

The Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that accurately predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. The model classifies incidents into three categories:

- **True Positive (TP)**
- **Benign Positive (BP)**
- **False Positive (FP)**

This classification enables SOC analysts to prioritize incidents and respond to threats more effectively.
